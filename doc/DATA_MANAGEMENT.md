# Data Management Plan

This document outlines the data management strategy for the **ResearchBook** project, describing the types of data, their locations, and their flow through the different stages of the research.

## 1. Raw and Simulation Data

This category includes the primary data generated from simulations or initial processing steps.

### üìç Location: `Tracking/Data/`

This directory is the central repository for data generated by the Moore simulation framework.

- **`Tracking/Data/Baseline/`**: Contains the output from running the baseline tracking algorithm. This serves as a reference point for performance comparisons.
- **`Tracking/Data/ModelIntegrated/`**: Stores the output from the tracking algorithm that has the custom ML model integrated.
- **`Tracking/Data/TrackDumper/`**: Contains data from a special "dumper" run, which saves detailed information about tracks for in-depth debugging and analysis.

**Flow**:
1.  **Generation**: Data is generated by running Moore simulations from the `Tracking/Moore/` subdirectories.
2.  **Consumption**: This data is the primary input for the analysis notebooks in `Tracking/Notebooks/`. Notebooks in `PostAnalysis/`, `DownstreamTracker/`, and `SciFiTracker/` read the `.root` files from these directories to evaluate model performance.

## 2. Calibration Data

This category includes data used for and generated by the calibration studies.

### üìç Location: `Calibration/01Notebooks/Data/`

- **`translator.pkl` & `universal_map.pkl`**: These appear to be serialized Python objects (pickles) used as inputs or lookup tables for the calibration notebooks.

**Flow**:
1.  **Generation**: These files are likely generated by an initial data preparation script or notebook (e.g., `00DataGeneration.ipynb`).
2.  **Consumption**: They are loaded by other notebooks in the `Calibration/01Notebooks/` directory to perform various analyses like clustering, plotting, and LSTM modeling.

## 3. Model Files

This category includes the trained machine learning models.

### üìç Location: `WorkingDirectory/Models/`

- **`DownstreamModel.json` & `LLPModel.json`**: JSON representations of trained models, likely for easy integration into the C++ tracking code.
- **`catboost_info/`**: A directory containing training logs and artifacts from a CatBoost model, generated during the training process in the `CatboostModel.ipynb` notebook.

**Flow**:
1.  **Generation**: Models are trained in Jupyter notebooks (e.g., `WorkingDirectory/Models/CatboostModel.ipynb`).
2.  **Consumption**: The exported model files (like the `.json` files) are read by the C++ code in `Tracking/Models/` when running the model-integrated simulations.

## 4. Plots and Figures

This category includes all visual outputs from the analysis.

### üìç Locations:
- **`Calibration/01Notebooks/Plots/`**: Organized into subdirectories corresponding to the notebooks that generated them.
- **`Calibration/02DashBoardsLSTM/Plots/`**: Plots specifically for the LSTM dashboards.
- **`Tracking/Notebooks/Figures/`**: Organized by analysis type (e.g., `FinalModel`, `ModelCompare`).

**Flow**:
- **Generation**: These plots are the final output of the analysis notebooks. They are saved to disk to be used in presentations, reports, or publications.
