# Project Structure

This document provides a detailed overview of the directory structure of the **ResearchBook** project.

## Root Directory

The root directory contains the main project files and three primary subdirectories: `Calibration`, `Tracking`, and `WorkingDirectory`.

- `README.md`: The main README file for the project, containing version information, platform details, and setup instructions.
- `Calibration/`: Contains notebooks and scripts for calibration tasks.
- `Tracking/`: The core directory for particle tracking research, including models, simulation configurations, and analysis notebooks.
- `WorkingDirectory/`: A space for ongoing work and experimentation.
- `doc/`: Contains project documentation.
